=======

A C++ implementation of the ggrfid.ino.

All functionality has been wraped into a library class. All funcions provided by
ggrfid.ino has been included as methods so you can scan tags, read and write with
a few funtion calls.

Use the original C code is very uncomfortable to use in arduino, it's the only reason I've done this arduino library.

Check the example for more details.

The author of original code is Dr.Leong (WWW.B2CQSHOP.COM) and I hope that my work
will not make him angry!
